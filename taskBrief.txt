Our platform intensively involve development using PHP/MySQL/HTML/CSS and currently we have quite a lot of candidates.

We’d like to assess your programming skills before arranging an interview with you.

Please can you write the (very simple) web page below and send it to us for review. We will then evaluate this and, hopefully, book in a time with you for a Zoom-based interview.

The program we would like you to write and send through to me now should do the following:

• Written in PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and/or jQuery
• Creates a MySQL table called “prices” with the following data in it:
o Description, price
o Apples, 27
o Oranges,83
o Bananas,12
• The program must be a web page to retrieve this data and display it on the screen in a table. Please send us the source code of your page(s) and, if you can, an example of it running somewhere.

When you’re ready, please copy and paste your code to me on this indeed chat system as usual.
If you have any questions, please just let me know.
Best,
Eddy.
