hello Eddy,

please see draft of the site. The links are below.
Really enjoyed working on this mini project.
Hope to make it through to the next round.

I created web and mysql server on my home pc and is hosted from our network;
however the link to the site may change as BT frequently change our public IP address.
I'll keep my eye on this, hoping BT keeps our IP the same for the next few days.

Also I created Github repo for you to see the code. The link is below as well. 


thank you again
and hope to hear from you
Lucy
